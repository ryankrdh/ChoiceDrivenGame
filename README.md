## Project Summary:
The interactive storybook project is a web-based application that allows users to experience a story as a **Shiba Inu** dog. The story unfolds through a series of scenes with **descriptive texts** and interactive choices that users can make. Along the way, the users can pick up and use various items to influence the dog's health and energy levels. The project is designed to provide an engaging and immersive experience for the users as they explore different scenarios and interact with the virtual world.

## Key Features:
* **Scene-Based Storytelling:** The storybook is structured into scenes, each with its descriptive text and background image. Users progress through the story by making choices that lead to different scenes, shaping the dog's journey.
  
* **Interactive Choices:** Users have the freedom to make choices on behalf of the **Shiba Inu** dog. These choices influence the storyline and can lead to different outcomes.

* **Item Collection and Usage:** Throughout the story, users can find and collect items such as food, water, treats, and more. These items can be used strategically to replenish the dog's health and energy.

* **Health and Energy Bars:** The application includes health and energy bars to display the dog's current status. These bars indicate the dog's health and energy levels, affected by the user's choices and item usage.

* **Enemy Battles:** Certain scenes involve encounters with other animals like cats, dogs, seagulls, etc. Users can engage in battles with these enemies, and the outcomes will impact the dog's health and the story's progression.

* **Audio Integration:** The application includes audio elements such as background music, sounds of the dog's actions, enemy encounters, etc., to enhance the overall experience.

* **User Progress Tracking:** The application keeps track of the user's progress through the story, ensuring they can continue from where they left off.

* **Save and Reset:** Users can save their progress and reset the game to start again with a new storyline or make different choices.

* **Responsive Design:** The project is designed with responsive web design principles, ensuring compatibility across various devices and screen sizes.

* **User Experience (UX) Enhancements:** The project focuses on providing an enjoyable and intuitive user experience, with clear instructions and easy-to-navigate interfaces.
